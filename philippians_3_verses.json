  "3:3": "For it is we who are the circumcision, we who serve God by his Spirit, who boast in Christ Jesus, and who put no confidence in the flesh—",
  "3:4": "though I myself have reasons for such confidence. If someone else thinks they have reasons to put confidence in the flesh, I have more:",
  "3:5": "circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; in regard to the law, a Pharisee;",
  "3:6": "as for zeal, persecuting the church; as for righteousness based on the law, faultless.",
  "3:7": "But whatever were gains to me I now consider loss for the sake of Christ.",
  "3:8": "What is more, I consider everything a loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have lost all things. I consider them garbage, that I may gain Christ",
  "3:9": "and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ—the righteousness that comes from God on the basis of faith.",
  "3:10": "I want to know Christ—yes, to know the power of his resurrection and participation in his sufferings, becoming like him in his death,",
  "3:11": "and so, somehow, attaining to the resurrection from the dead.",
  "3:12": "Not that I have already obtained all this, or have already arrived at my goal, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me.",
  "3:13": "Brothers and sisters, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead,",
  "3:14": "I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus.",
  "3:15": "All of us, then, who are mature should take such a view of things. And if on some point you think differently, that too God will make clear to you.",
  "3:16": "Only let us live up to what we have already attained.",
  "3:17": "Join together in following my example, brothers and sisters, and just as you have us as a model, keep your eyes on those who live as we do.",
  "3:18": "For, as I have often told you before and now tell you again even with tears, many live as enemies of the cross of Christ.",
  "3:19": "Their destiny is destruction, their god is their stomach, and their glory is in their shame. Their mind is set on earthly things.",
  "3:20": "But our citizenship is in heaven. And we eagerly await a Savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ,",
  "3:21": "who, by the power that enables him to bring everything under his control, will transform our lowly bodies so that they will be like his glorious body."
