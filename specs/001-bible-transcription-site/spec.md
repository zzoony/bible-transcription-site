## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A Bible student wants to quickly find and deeply understand specific Bible verses. They enter a search term (word, phrase, or reference), browse through relevant results, and access comprehensive linguistic analysis including original text structure, vocabulary definitions with pronunciations, cultural context, and natural Korean translations.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user visits the application, **When** they enter "love" in the search box, **Then** they see a list of verses containing the word "love" with preview text and references
2. **Given** search results are displayed, **When** a user clicks on a specific verse, **Then** they see the complete analysis including sentence structure, vocabulary, context, and translations
3. **Given** a user is viewing verse analysis, **When** they want to share or copy the content, **Then** they can easily copy the verse reference and text or share via standard sharing mechanisms
4. **Given** a user accesses the application on a mobile device, **When** they perform any action, **Then** the interface adapts appropriately for their screen size
5. **Given** a user prefers dark mode, **When** they toggle the theme, **Then** the entire interface switches to a dark color scheme

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a search returns no results?
- How does the system handle searches with very large result sets (100+ verses)?
- What occurs when a user accesses a verse that has incomplete analysis data?
- How does the system behave when network connectivity is poor or interrupted?
