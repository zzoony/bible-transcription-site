# Implementation Plan: Bible Transcription Site - Modern Web Application

**Branch**: `001-bible-transcription-site` | **Date**: 2025-09-29 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-bible-transcription-site/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Modern web application for comprehensive Bible verse analysis providing search functionality, detailed linguistic breakdowns, and Korean translations. Users can search verses by content or reference, view complete linguistic analysis including sentence structure, vocabulary with IPA/Korean pronunciation, cultural context, and natural Korean translations. Built with Next.js frontend, Supabase backend, using shadcn/ui components following v0 design patterns.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript with Next.js 14+ (App Router)
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js, Supabase client, shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI primitives
**Storage**: Supabase PostgreSQL (existing schema with 715 rows of analysis data)
**Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library, Playwright for E2E
**Target Platform**: Web browsers (desktop, tablet, mobile), Progressive Web App
**Project Type**: web - determines frontend + backend structure
**Performance Goals**: <2s initial load, <500ms search response, 60fps UI animations
**Constraints**: WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility, mobile-first responsive design, offline search capability
**Scale/Scope**: 10k+ concurrent users, 100k+ Bible verses, modern web standards compliance

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Constitution Status**: Template-based (no project-specific constitution found)
- ✅ Library-first approach: Frontend/backend separation with reusable components
- ✅ CLI interface: All utilities support command-line interaction
- ✅ Test-first development: TDD cycle with contract tests before implementation
- ✅ Integration testing: API contracts and E2E user scenarios
- ✅ Observability: Structured logging and error handling throughout
- ✅ Simplicity: Standard Next.js patterns, minimal custom abstractions

**Structure Decision**: Selected web application structure with Next.js App Router. Frontend-only approach using Supabase as backend service, eliminating need for separate backend directory. Focus on component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base structure
- Generate contract tests from `/contracts/` API specifications (search-api.md, verse-api.md)
- Create TypeScript type definitions from data-model.md entities
- Generate component tasks from project structure (VerseCard, SearchBar, etc.)
- Create integration tests from quickstart.md user journey scenarios
- Implementation tasks organized by TDD cycle (test → implement → refactor)

**Specific Task Categories**:
1. **Setup & Configuration** (1-3): Next.js project, Supabase client, shadcn/ui setup
2. **Type Definitions** (4-6): Entity interfaces, API response types, client state types
3. **Contract Tests** (7-12): Search API tests, Verse API tests, error handling tests
4. **Core Components** (13-20): SearchBar, VerseCard, AnalysisDisplay, Theme provider
5. **Pages & Routing** (21-25): Home page, search results, verse detail pages
6. **Integration Tests** (26-30): End-to-end user journeys from quickstart.md
7. **Performance & Accessibility** (31-35): PWA setup, A11y compliance, optimization

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Infrastructure first: Setup, types, client configuration
- TDD cycle: Contract tests → Components → Integration tests
- Dependencies: Core utilities → Components → Pages → Features
- Parallel execution: Mark [P] for independent component development
- Sequential gates: Tests must pass before moving to implementation

**Estimated Output**: 35-40 numbered, dependency-ordered tasks in tasks.md with clear TDD checkpoints

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

**No constitutional violations identified.** The proposed architecture follows standard patterns:
- Single web application (not multiple projects)
- Standard Next.js patterns (no custom abstractions)
- Direct Supabase client usage (no unnecessary repository layers)
- shadcn/ui components (industry standard, no custom UI library)

All complexity is justified by functional requirements and follows established best practices.


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:

- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS - No violations identified
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS - Standard patterns maintained
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved - Technical decisions documented in research.md
