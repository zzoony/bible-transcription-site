## Methodology

**Analysis Approach:**
1. Fetched all 21 verses from API endpoint: `http://localhost:3000/api/verse/philippians-3-{verse_number}`
2. Extracted NIV text and sentence_structure arrays from API responses
3. Split NIV text into actual sentences using period/exclamation/question mark delimiters
4. Compared sentence count vs structure count
5. Verified that all verses have at least one structure entry (0 verses had zero structures)
6. Categorized verses as COMPLETE (1:1) or DETAILED (semantic breakdown)

**Tools Used:**
- Python 3 for data analysis
- JSON parsing for API response handling
- Regular expressions for sentence boundary detection
