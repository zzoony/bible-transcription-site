## Analysis Methodology

### What We Checked

For each verse from Philippians 3:1 to 3:21:
1. Fetched API data from the local server
2. Extracted the NIV verse text
3. Counted actual sentences in the text (by periods, exclamation marks, question marks)
4. Counted sentence_structure entries in the API response
5. Verified that every verse has at least one structure entry

### Key Finding

The database uses a **semantic breakdown approach** where complex sentences are analyzed into multiple structural components. This means:

- **COMPLETE verses (9):** One structure per sentence (1:1 mapping)
- **DETAILED verses (12):** Multiple structures per sentence (semantic breakdown)

This is intentional and provides richer linguistic analysis, not missing data.
