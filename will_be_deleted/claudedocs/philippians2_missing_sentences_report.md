1. **Pattern:** Verses 2:1-11 are complete (Christ Hymn section), while verses 2:12-30 are mostly missing (practical application section)
2. **Multi-sentence verses:** 5 verses contain multiple sentences (2:15, 2:16, 2:27, 2:30)
3. **Total missing sentences:** Approximately 23 individual sentences need analysis
4. **Critical gap:** The entire second half of the chapter (verses 12-30) lacks sentence structure analysis

## Next Steps

1. Prioritize analysis of multi-sentence verses (2:15, 2:16, 2:27, 2:30)
2. Process remaining single-sentence verses in sequence
3. Maintain consistency with existing analysis style from verses 2:1-11
4. Ensure semantic classification includes both grammatical and meaning-based categories
